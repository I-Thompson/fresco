Dear Alberto,
	James Christley has passed on to me your query about the amplitudes
output in file 37 when LAMPL ne 0.
	You have it basically correct, but actually there is additional 
information in file 37 NOT described in the manual. The extra information is
supposed to make it easier to use the output file.

For each partition IC = |LAMPL|:

   for each excited state pair:
      	WRITE(37,*) JIX,JEX,NANGL,NEARF,ELAB
     for each of NANGL values of THETA:
      	WRITE(37,*) THETA
      	WRITE(37,265) (FAM(IAM),IAM=1,MAM)
     enddo
   enddo

Here: JIX(1:2) is array of projectile and target incoming spins,
      JEX(1:2) is array of projectile and target outgoing spins,
      NANGL: number of angles
      NEARF: 1 for near+far side, 2 for far side, 3 for near side,
      ELAB: lab projectile energy
      THETA: scattering angle in degrees (cm)
      FAM(1:MAM) the complex f(theta) values for MAM possible m-value
	combinations,
      MAM = NSA * NJA * NSB * NJB where
      NSA = 2*JIX(1) + 1
      NJA = 2*JIX(2) + 1
      NSB = 2*JEX(1) + 1
      NJB = 2*JEX(2) + 1
  		and the IAM=1:MAM values generated by:
         IAM = 0
      DO 222 IMA = 1,NSA
        MA = -JIX(1) + IMA-1
      DO 222 IJA = 1,NJA
        MJA = -JIX(2) + IJA-1
      DO 222 IMB = 1,NSB
        MB = -JEX(1) + IMB-1
      DO 222 IJB = 1,NJB
        MJB = -JEX(2) + IJB-1
         IAM = IAM + 1

222	continue

The cross sections are the usual sum of the |f|**2, summed over final
states (MJB,MB) and averaged over initial states (MJA,MA). 
This means multiplying by XCOEF:
      XCOEF = 10.0/(NSA * NJA)

 where the 10.0 factor is to convert fm**2 to mb.

I am sorry the manual was not clear on these points. 
In fact, I will use this occasion to include this kind of explanation
in a revised manual.

Thanks,
	Ian

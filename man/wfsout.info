WDISK
  = 1 :  Print elastic wave functions on output file 17, FORMATTED
  = 2 :  Print   all   wave functions on output file 17, FORMATTED

The following data formats are used when WDISK > 0 :

card A: (I4,2F8.4,F8.1,I3)          NR,H,ENLAB,JTOTAL,PARITY : 
			number radial points, step size, lab. energy,  J,pi
			[int, real, real, real, int(+1 or -1)]
card B: (2I4,2F6.1,I4,F6.1,2F15.10)
         IT,L,J,JTOT,LIN,JIN,SMAT (complex)

where

IT = index to excited state pair, counts cards 7.
L  = partial wave
J  = L + projectile spin
JTOT = total spin = J_{total} = J + target spin
LIN  = incoming partial wave
JIN  = incoming J value.
SMAT = S matrix element for this partial wave.


card C: (6E12.4)   (psi(I),I=1,NR)   wave function
card C is repeated until NR complex values given
NB: the first point psi(1) = 0 always, as at r=0

Cards B \& C are repeated for each channel, until IT < 0.

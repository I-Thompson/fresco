 Centre-of-mass Range is    102 * 0.1000 fm., Maximum at  10.00 fm., Interpolating NL forms every  0.50 fm.
 Non - locality width is      4 * 0.1000 fm., Maximum of   0.30 fm., Centred at  0.00 fm.
 2-Nucleon Separation of      0 * 0.5000 fm., Maximum of   0.00 fm., Minimum at  0.00 fm.
 Maximum single particle bins of 10.0000 fm.
               M,Mint =          101         101


 Range of total J is     0.0 <= J <=     3.0 (at least     0.0) and Absorbtion =>    -1.0000 mb.
 Dry Run = F, CC set limits =  0  0, Relativistic kinematics =  , Both/Far/Near Analyses =  1                     

 Cross Sections (and up to T0 for 0=projectile) for Theta from  50.0 to 180.0 in steps of 20.0 degrees, DGAM=0,  Coordinates = 0 (Mads)

 Lower Radial Cutoff = maximum of -1.60*L*h &       0.0 fm.,  Lower Cutoff for Couplings =   0.0  fm.


 Iterate Couplings between   0 and   0 times, to  0.000 % if sooner.                                          
  Block solved exactly =   0 chs., with Pade = 0 & Isocen =  =0, NOSOL = F, initwf =  0
  NL quadrature with   18 Gaussian points, Calculate multipoles up to     9 from   0
  M-transfers for lp+lt greater than or equal to  6, Angular Integration Cutoff below  2.7778 %


 Trace switches are :  CHANS =  1, LISTCC =  0, TRENEG =  1, CDETR =  0, SMATS =  2, XSTABL =  0, NLPL =  0

                       WAVES =  0, LAMPL =  0, VEFF =  0, KFUS =  0, WDISK =  0, BPM =  0, MELFIL =  0

                       CDCC =  0, NFUS =  0

 Using unit mass = 1.000000 amu and 1/fine-structure constant = 137.03599 ( 1.000000 * true ) with hc = 197.32705 MeV.fm,
  thus 2*amu/hbar^2 = 0.0478450 = 1/20.9008 and Coulomb constant = 0.1574855 so e^2 = 1.43997, and nuclear magneton= 0.1261183
